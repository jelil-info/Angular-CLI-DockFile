HOW TO START AND STOP DOCKER
FIRST, OPEN first PANNEL AND ENTER "docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 sportsstore"
After pannel displays the following:
 "      HTTP Server running on port 80
       HTTPS Server running on port 443     "
       
       It means DOCKER has started but when you want to stop DOCKER open the
       second PANNEL and follow these steps:
       
       "  To stop the container, run the command shown in Listing 10-18.
Listing 10-18. Listing the Containers

You will see a list of running containers, like this (I have omitted some fields for brevity):

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE

Using the value in the Container ID column, run the command shown in Listing 10-19.
