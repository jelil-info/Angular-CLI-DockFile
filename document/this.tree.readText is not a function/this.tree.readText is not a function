When I wanted to do install "pwa" through the following: "ng add @angular/pwa" 
I encountered the following Error:

"oyekanmi@Oyekanmi-Oyetunji:~/Documents/Angular/ProAngular9/ngServe$ ng add @angular/pwa
Your global Angular CLI version (15.1.1) is greater than your local version (9.0.3). The local Angular CLI version is used.

To disable this warning use "ng config -g cli.warnings.versionMismatch false".
Installing packages for tooling via npm.

this.tree.readText is not a function"

I solved the above Error by following the following steps:

"This problem happened to me when I tried to add service workers to my app using Angular's Progressive Web App (PWA) capability. I na√Øvely ran ng add @angular/pwa, but my global Angular CLI version was newer than my project's Angular version. That means the @angular/pwa version was too new for my Angular project, which caused the error message that this question describes.

Here's how I solved it:

Run npm remove @angular/pwa.
Check https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/pwa?activeTab=versions to find the correct version number for your project. The Tag field tells you the Angular version to which the package version corresponds.
Run ng add again for the correct version. For example, run npm add @angular/pwa@0.803 for an old Angular 8 project."


I used "ng add @angular/pwa@0.901.15" to install "PWA"
