WHEN I OPENED "SportsStore APPLICATION" THROUGH "http://localhost:4200/store"  
AN ERROR OCCURED WHICH IS THAT THE "SportsStore APPLICATION" DO NOT SHOW THE
DATA-SOURCE OF THE APPLICATION I THEN CHECKED GOOGLE CHROME CONSOLE WHICH SHOWED
THE FOLLOWING ERROR:

"Angular is running in the development mode. Call enableProdMode() to enable the production mode.
:3500/products:1          Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
core.js:5873 ERROR HttpErrorResponse
defaultErrorLogger @ core.js:5873
client:52 [WDS] Live Reloading enabled."

I SOLVED THE ABOVE ERROR BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTION OF THE BOOK I AM READING,
WHICH IS AS THE FOLLOWING:

"Preparing the Example Application
No preparation is required for this chapter, which continues using the SportsStore project from Chapter 8.
To start the RESTful web service, open a command prompt and run the following command in the
SportsStore folder:

"npm run json"

Open a second command prompt and run the following command in the SportsStore folder to start
the development tools and HTTP server:

"ng serve --open"
